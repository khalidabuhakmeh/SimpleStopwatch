# Simple Stopwatch

I wanted to write a macOS stopwatch, so I did.

To get started, you'll need the following:

- XCode
- Xamarin Tools 
- An IDE (I recommend [JetBrains Rider](https://jetbrains.com/rider))

The majority of the C# code can be found in [ViewController.cs](SimpleStopwatch/ViewController.cs).
